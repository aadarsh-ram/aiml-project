#### Title: A comparative study of ML classifiers on the Pima Indians Dataset

This repository contains the code and the dataset used for the AI/ML course project.

### Instructions for execution

- Create and activate virtualenv

```
python -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
```

- Install required packages
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Open the Jupyter Notebook in a code editor of your choice, with the Python kernel in `venv` environment.
- Execute the cells and get the output from each cell.  
- Note: The metrics of each classifier will vary, since the training and testing set is chosen randomly for each run.
